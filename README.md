The classic Python snake game is a popular programming exercise. Here’s an overview of how it works without diving into the code itself:

### Objective
The goal of the game is to maneuver a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, making the game progressively more challenging.

### Main Components

1. **Game Board (Grid or Canvas)**:
   - This is the area where the game takes place. It can be visualized as a grid or a canvas where the snake moves and the food appears.
   - In many implementations, the board is created using a graphical library like Pygame, where the screen is divided into smaller units (like a grid).

2. **Snake**:
   - The snake is typically represented as a series of connected blocks or segments.
   - It moves in a specified direction and grows in length when it eats food.
   - The position of each segment of the snake is tracked, often using a list or a queue.

3. **Food**:
   - Food items appear randomly on the board and are represented as single blocks or small shapes.
   - When the snake’s head collides with the food, the food is "eaten," the snake grows, and new food is generated at a random location.

4. **Movement and Control**:
   - The snake moves continuously in the current direction (up, down, left, or right).
   - Players can change the direction using input controls, usually arrow keys or WASD keys.
   - The direction change is typically restricted to avoid immediate reversal (e.g., the snake cannot directly go from left to right).

5. **Collision Detection**:
   - The game needs to detect collisions between the snake and the walls or the snake’s body.
   - Collision with the wall or itself results in the game ending.
   - This is managed by checking the coordinates of the snake's head relative to the boundaries and its own segments.

6. **Score**:
   - The score increases as the snake eats food.
   - Each piece of food typically adds a fixed number of points to the score.
   - The score can be displayed on the screen for the player to track their progress.

7. **Game Loop**:
   - The game runs in a continuous loop that updates the snake’s position, checks for collisions, and redraws the game board.
   - The speed of the game loop can be controlled to make the game easier or harder.

### Game Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set up the game board, place the snake in its starting position, and generate the initial food.
   
2. **Game Loop**:
   - Update the position of the snake based on its current direction.
   - Check if the snake’s head has collided with food, a wall, or its own body.
   - If food is eaten, increase the length of the snake and place new food.
   - If a collision with the wall or the snake's body is detected, end the game.
   - Render the updated state of the game (snake, food, score) on the screen.

3. **Player Input**:
   - Continuously listen for player input to change the direction of the snake.

4. **Game Over**:
   - Display the final score and provide options to restart the game or exit.

### Summary
The Python snake game combines basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and data structures with real-time input handling and graphical updates. It’s a great project for learning and practicing game development fundamentals.
